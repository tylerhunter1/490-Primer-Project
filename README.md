# 490-Primer-Project


LOG:

created primer.cgi file

started initially with just concatenating QUERY_STRING line

added a photo to webpage in html

decided to make a name appender

started by writing out just the form field for input

new to web development, so I had no idea how to output what was put in the field

looked up ways to write a script for output

wrote a simple script to output  firstname + " " + lastname

changed the format of the html around a bit until I liked it

transfered the primer.cgi file to the ssh server

copied the file to my working directory and changed permissions

was able to view everything on a web browser!




SUMMARY STATUS:

Project is now complete with all requirements fulfilled. 
Was fairly stressful until I figured out what I was doing
