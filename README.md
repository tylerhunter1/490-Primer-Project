# 490-Primer-Project


LOG:

wrote a file reader class in Java and tried to get it working like simple.cgi

worked fine in the JGrasp compiler, but wasn't able to figure out how to connect it with CGI and the browser

ended up trashing the Java and switching to bash

created primer.cgi file in bash

started initially with just concatenating QUERY_STRING line

added a photo to webpage in html

decided to make a name appender

started by writing out just the form field for input

new to web development, so I had no idea how to output what was put in the field

looked up ways to write a script for output

wrote a simple script to output  firstname + " " + lastname

changed the format of the html around a bit until I liked it

transfered the primer.cgi file to the ssh server

copied the file to my working directory and changed permissions

was able to view everything on a web browser!




SUMMARY STATUS:

Project is now complete with all requirements fulfilled. 
Was fairly stressful until I figured out how to connect each working part. 
I initially tried writing it in Java, but was a little confused on how to connect Java and CGI, so I looked up how to do it in bash, which was much easier.
